## Welcome!

I'm Demian Ferreiro, a programmer from Argentina who loves writing software that doesn't suck.

Here is where i publish my thoughts on software and other things. I also have a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DemianFerreiro/) where i very irregularly upload stuff.

You can also find me as @epidemian on online places like [GitHub](https://github.com/epidemian), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/epidemian.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@epidemian), and others. Or, if you're old-school, you can [email me](mailto:epidemian+blog@gmail.com).
<!-- TODO: mention other sites like Hacker News, Lobsters, StackOverflow, Twitter, etc. Maybe put these on an expandable thing triggered by the "others" word. -->

My résumé/CV is [here](/resume).

## Welcome!

I'm Demian Ferreiro, a programmer from Argentina who loves writing software that doesn't suck.

Here is where i publish my thoughts on software and other things. I also have a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DemianFerreiro/) where i very irregularly upload stuff.

You can also find me as @epidemian on online places like [GitHub](https://github.com/epidemian), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@epidemian), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/epidemian), and others. Or, if you're old-school, you can send me [an email](mailto:epidemian+blog@gmail.com).

Oh, and i'm available for hire or freelancing work! My résumé/CV is [here](/resume).

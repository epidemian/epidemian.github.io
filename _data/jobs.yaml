    My first fully remote and distributed experience —luckily starting before Covid!—, for one of the leading freelancing platforms worldwide.
    - Worked on the front-ends for both the client-facing and the freelancer-facing web applications. These were complex React projects, with multiple teams working on different initiatives simultaneously. This required a great deal of effective collaboration.
    - Occasionally contributed to other projects, like the big Ruby on Rails monolithic backend, or the Cucumber-based end-to-end integration test.
    - Interviewed engineering candidates for front-end roles.
    - Built a chat component for communication between freelancers and their clients. One of the first "live updates" projects in the company (i.e. app reacting to server events).
    - Designed an architecture proposal for a unified publish/subscribe event bus to have live updates across all company applications.
    - Gave a "workshop" for learning how to solve the Rubik's cube during a team offsite meetup. At least 3 teammates learned the whole thing.
  buzzwords: [TypeScript, React, Jest, GraphQL, WebSockets, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Cucumber, Docker]

    Worked on a restaurant booking platform as a full stack web developer and technical lead.
    - Modernized the diner-facing website, rewriting a classic Rails site into a "modern" React application with bells and whistles: Redux, TypeScript, a fat GraphQL layer. In hindsight, not a good idea: it wasn't worth the development cost and complexity.
    - Worked closely with Product stakeholders, to try to bridge the gap between our engineering initiatives and business needs.
    - Won a hackathon for a PoC of a better search service. Then lead the development to bring that idea to production, replacing an ad-hoc Lucene-based service that suffered from downtime, scalability and maintainability problems with a vanilla Elasticsearch solution, which proved to be better on all those fronts.
  buzzwords: [TypeScript, React, Redux, GraphQL, Node.js, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Elasticsearch, Docker, Kubernetes]

    Started a platform for booking tourism activities with two colleagues, after receiving some funding. Designed the architecture and worked on both the backend —a relatively simple Sinatra API— and front-end —a web application implemented with Mithril.js. Even though this startup attempt didn't took off in the end, the experience was definitely worth it.

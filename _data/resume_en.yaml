  - content: |
      I'm a software developer with more than 15 years of professional experience, most recently working on web applications, as well as backend services and technical leadership.

      I'm fluent in Ruby, Java/TypeScript, and English. I've also written my fair share of Java, Python, SQL, Bash, C++, Rust, and many more. I like learning, and care about detail, so I tend to go in-depth in whatever I'm working on.

      I always have a user-first perspective when developing software. So valuing aspects like correctness, simplicity, or performance comes naturally: users like non-buggy, easy-to-use, and fast software.

      I've worked in teams of many sizes, from tiny startups where I was the sole developer of the whole backend, to big organizations where the coordination between hundreds of developers was a big challenge. And from greenfield projects to maintenance and modernization of legacy systems.

      ### Skills, or what I do...

      - Develop complex web applications using the modern React-centric approach.
      - Prefer writing "classic" web pages —with server-side rendered HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript— when interactivity is low and the complexity of JS frameworks is not justified.
      - Develop and deploy backend services.
      - Work with other developers to design complex systems. And always keep an eye on opportunities to reduce incidental complexity.
      - Write technical documentation and give internal talks.
      - Collaborate with product managers to plan and prioritize features.
      - Write and contribute to open source projects.
      - Mentor new developers, review code, and help with establishing good engineering practices and camaraderie.
      - Interview and review hiring candidates.

    items:
      - role: Senior Front-end Engineer
        org: <a href="https://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a>
        location: remote
        time: 2019 to 2022
        description: |
          My first fully remote and distributed experience, on one of the leading freelancing platforms worldwide. I worked mainly as a "modern" web front-end developer —i.e. React centric— for both the client-facing and the freelancer-facing applications. I was also lucky to contribute to other areas on the tech stack, like the classic monolithic Ruby on Rails backend, or the end-to-end Cucumber-defined test suite.

          This was a huge learning experience, not only in acclimatizing to remote work (before the Covid pandemic), but also working on a big organization with a lot of "product" complexities.
        buzzwords: [JavaScript, React, react-testing-library, Apollo GraphQL, WebSockets, Figma, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Cucumber, Docker]

          Worked on the restaurant booking platform as a full stack web developer and technical lead. Contributed mainly to the development and architecture of a new web frontend written in the "JS centric" way, with React/Redux, and a GraphQL layer that interfaced different APIs and served both the web and the mobile native apps. I also participated in other backend projects written in Ruby/Rails, as well as more "classic" fronted web projects. It was a great learning experience.

          Developed a tourism web application from the ground up with two colleagues. A truly full-stack and architecture-design experience. The back-end was a simple Ruby/Sinatra API while the front-end was a JavaScript application that used Mithril.js as a lightweight view layer. Though the project/startup didn't lift off in the end, it was a very valuable and fun endeavor.
        buzzwords: [JavaScript, Mithril.js, Ruby, Sinatra, REST, Heroku]

        role: Senior Front-end Engineer
        location: remote
        time: 2019 to 2022
        description: |
          My first fully remote and distributed experience, on one of the leading freelancing platforms worldwide. I worked mainly as a "modern" web front-end developer —i.e. React centric— for both the client-facing and the freelancer-facing applications. I was also lucky to contribute to other areas on the tech stack, like the classic monolithic Ruby on Rails backend, or the end-to-end Cucumber-defined test suite.

          This was a huge learning experience, not only in acclimatizing to remote work (before the Covid pandemic), but also working on a big organization with a lot of "product" complexities.
        buzzwords: [JavaScript, React, react-testing-library, Apollo GraphQL, WebSockets, Figma, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Cucumber, Docker]

        role: Web developer

        time: 2016 to 2019
        description: |
          Worked on the restaurant booking platform as a full stack web developer and technical lead. Contributed mainly to the development and architecture of a new web frontend written in the "JS centric" way, with React/Redux, and a GraphQL layer that interfaced different APIs and served both the web and the mobile native apps. I also participated in other backend projects written in Ruby/Rails, as well as more "classic" fronted web projects. It was a great learning experience.
        buzzwords: [JavaScript, React, Redux, GraphQL, Node.js, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Docker, Kubernetes]

        location: Buenos Aires
        time: 2016
        description: |
          Developed a tourism web application from the ground up with two colleagues. A truly full-stack and architecture-design experience. The back-end was a simple Ruby/Sinatra API while the front-end was a JavaScript application that used Mithril.js as a lightweight view layer. Though the project/startup didn't lift off in the end, it was a very valuable and fun endeavor.
        buzzwords: [JavaScript, Mithril.js, Ruby, Sinatra, REST]

          Worked on two medium-sized projects for Sumavisos: an existing jobs web portal, and a new restaurant booking website. Later on I worked on the real-estate site Properati. All these projects had similar architectures, using Ruby/Rails on the back-end, while the front-end was a classic server-rendered HTML site with JS sprinkled in.
